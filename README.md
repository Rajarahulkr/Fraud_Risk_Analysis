📊 Paisabazaar Credit Risk Analysis 
📌 Overview

This project presents an end-to-end data analysis of the Paisabazaar customer credit dataset to understand customer financial behavior, creditworthiness, and risk patterns.
The analysis demonstrates how a Data Analyst uses structured data, KPIs, and visual insights to support business and risk-management decisions in the financial services industry.

📈 Key Insights (Data Analyst Perspective)

Most customers fall into the Standard credit category, while Good and Poor scorers show sharply different financial behavior.

Outstanding Debt, EMI, and Utilization Ratio clearly separate Good and Poor credit scorers.

Income alone is not a strong predictor of credit score; repayment discipline matters more.

Customers paying only minimum dues are significantly more likely to have poor credit scores.

Frequent payment delays are strong indicators of financial stress and default risk.

Customers with multiple loan types and heavy reliance on credit cards/personal loans tend to belong to weaker credit segments.

Correlation analysis confirmed debt and utilization metrics as critical risk indicators.

🧠 Business Value

Supports credit risk assessment teams with actionable insights

Helps detect early warning signals for default risk

Enables customer segmentation for targeted interventions

Improves decision-making for loan approvals

Reduces long-term financial and fraud risk

🏁 Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates how a Data Analyst can transform raw financial data into business-ready insights. The study shows that repayment behavior, credit utilization, and EMI burden are stronger indicators of credit risk than income alone.

By identifying high-risk behaviors such as high utilization, minimum-only payments, and frequent delays, the project highlights opportunities for early intervention, improved risk models, and responsible lending strategies—strengthening both customer trust and institutional stability.
